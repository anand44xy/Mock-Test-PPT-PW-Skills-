Q.1 Create a superclass called Animal with a method makeSound() that prints the sound made by the animal. Implement subclasses Dog, Cat, and Cow that inherit from the Animal class. Implement the makeSound() method in each subclass to print the sound made by a dog, cat, and cow, respectively.
Ans.
package MockTest;

//Super class
class Animal{
    void makeSound(){
        System.out.println("Sound made by Animal.");
    }
}

//sub-class
class Dog extends Animal{
    @Override
    void makeSound(){
        System.out.println("Sound made by Dog");
    }
}

// sub-class
class Cat extends Animal{
     @Override
    void makeSound(){
        System.out.println("Sound made by Cat");
    }
}

// sub-class
class Cow extends Animal{
    @Override
    void makeSound(){
        System.out.println("Sound made by Cow");
    }
}

public class Question1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal objDog=new Dog();
        Animal objCat=new Cat();
        Animal objCow=new Cow();
        
        objDog.makeSound();
        objCat.makeSound();
        objCow.makeSound();

    }
}
